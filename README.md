The owls will whisper a unique password that looks like it is upper-case ASCII,
_but which is actually made of Greek, Coptic, and Cyrillic Unicode!_

To a certain extent, depending on typeface and rendering,
an adversary can create a photograph, screenshot, or brain-memory of the password and
it will be of little use to them.
The unicode values of the glyphs are ambiguous under visual inspection.

The entropy of the password is printed.
The entropy of the visual ambiguity is substantially less,
but _it should be enough!_
