The owls will speak a unique password that looks like upper-case ASCII,
but which is actually composed of homoglyphs from other Unicode code pages.

A photograph, screenshot, or visual memory can be created of the password
but it won't be of any use because you cannot visually tell of which Unicode
characters the password consists.
