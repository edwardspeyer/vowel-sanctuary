The owls will whisper a unique password that looks like it is upper-case ASCII,
_but which is actually made of Greek, Coptic, and Cyrillic Unicode!_

A photograph, screenshot, or brain-memory can be created of the password
but it won't be of any use because the passwords characters are ambiguous.

The entropy of the password is printed.
The entropy of the visual ambiguity is substantially less,
but _it should be enough!_
